# Sorting Hat 2.0

Reworked for a frontend interface, frontend/json configuration, and reproducible/auditable results

## Dev Setup

This repo uses webpack. The main entry file is index.html, and source js files are in /src.

The vue template is generated with `vue-cli`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Sorting Algorithm

## For Development

Run `yarn install -D`

To get webpack to automatically detect changes and rebuild the scripts, run `yarn dev`.

### When you're done:

Run `yarn build` (This will automatically be in production mode due to `webpack.config.js`)
