HELP EMERGENCY HAS ANYONE SEEN MY BBY???? HE IS 22/165/63/CHINESE MASC 4 MASC??? I THINK LAST I SAW HIM HE WAS WEARING PINK??? I THINK IF YOU SEE HIM TMR HE WILL BE WEARING PINK TOO???
(Ok seriously) If you're coming down for Pink Dot 2016 tomorrow, please visit the Inter-Uni LGBT Network booth at which Gender Collective will also be!
We have a Warm Fuzzies exchange activity, where you get to receive handwritten letters from the public in return for writing one to them! ❤️✉️ There'll also be a photobooth where you can take pictures with cheesy props with your friends! ❤️
Our booths will be at the Community Tent, and we'll be at the corner of the tent that is right next to a large LED screen. See you there for the above two activities AND U CAN ALSO HELP MII FIND MY BBY???
